CHILLBOT SOCIAL LICENSE
Version 0.1.0

Redistribution and use is permitted, subject to ALL of the following conditions:

1. The software is provided AS-IS, without any warranty of any kind, and you take full
   responsibility for your use of it. In no event shall the copyright holders be held
   liable for any damages related in any way to your use of the software.

2. The software may only be used or distributed by Permitted Entities, as defined below;
   it may not be used by any Prohibited Entities, as defined below, for any purpose
   whatsoever. Use by a Prohibited Entity extends to the actions taken by an individual
   person on behalf of or in service to said Entity. This includes, but is not limited to,
   duties performed by a person in their line of work as an employee or contractor of a
   Prohibited Entity.

3. The software may not be used in any way which could impede or block any person's travel
   across a geopolitical border.

4. The software may not be used in any way which could discriminate against people
   marginalized by race, religious affiliation, socioeconomic status, gender (including
   gender identity), sexual orientation, disability, or past criminalization by a
   state. The software may not be used to process data which contains latent biases around
   the above marginalizing factors, when the processed data will be used in ways which
   discriminate and reinforce these biases; or when the processed data will be made
   available in a form which could, intentionally or unintentionally, lead another party
   to do so.

5. The software may not be used to automatically collect or process information from
   people who have not provided explicit, informed, wholly optional, and unambiguous
   consent. Such consent is not considered wholly optional if declining to consent would
   bar a person from using a service or entering a public or semi-public place.

6. Permitted Entities may use services provided by a Prohibited Entity in order to
   redistribute the software, but may not further permit those Prohibited Entities to
   execute or use the software.

7. Redistributions of the software (in source or binary form) must include all copyright
   notices and the full text of this license.

8. The software may be modified and redistributed, so long as all derivative works are
   also distributed under this license.

9. Redistributions of the software in binary form must provide the source code, either
   along with the binary form, or in a way which is equally easy and obvious to obtain.
